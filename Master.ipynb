This research study involves an integrated approach and extensive data collection both primary and secondary including the satellite imagery, ancillary data, field data, various factors for identification of fire hotspot areas, forest fire susceptibility mapping using multi-criteria decision making. Landsat 8 data will be obtained from USGS-EROS to generate NDVI, burn ratio (NBR). Tree Height measuring instrument will in the end help in authentic CO2 emissions using various algorithms. In order to identify the potential fire risk areas to aid in devising appropriate strategies for avoiding/minimizing damage caused by forest fires in the study area in future, number of factors will be used for forest fire risk zone mapping using AHP. These factors will also be used in creation of an ANN model to predict forest fire peaks, optimization of the fire control configuration through the use of a forest fire spread model with an improved accuracy. A novel solution in this research harnesses a network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and a fleet of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). If a fire ignites, IoT devices deployed in the area will detect it and wait until a patrolling UAV is within transmission range to report their measurements.

To further describe the pests and weeds that are common specifically in certain locations, a manual random survey analysis of the pests and weeds will be conducted initially. We will initially choose our input parameters in order to help users predict the growth of pests and weeds and give them ample lead time to regulate the dynamics of pest and weed growth. Data on weeds and pests will be collected from various tehsil Taxila locations. Weed and pest proliferation throughout the three to five week observation period led to this decision. This is the stage that is most important for safeguarding crops and reducing insect populations. In order to represent the input information, the environmental data being recorded in successive series will be used to collect the temperature and relative humidity on a daily basis throughout the season. The effectiveness of the suggested characterization for the app's design is determined by how accurately our technique predicts the arrival of pests and weeds in a three to five-week window, providing the user time to take action and limit the expansion of the pests and weeds population. A skilled IT professional will help with the app designing process after careful characterization. Currently, there is no defined method for gathering weeds and pests. The accurate detection of weeds and pests in cultivated fields is made possible by the use of UAVs and machine learning techniques, which can also increase the sustainability of weed and pest management. In order to reduce the selection pressure against herbicide/pesticide-resistant weeds/pests and the diffusion of herbicides/pesticides in the environment, weed and pest detection by UAVs can help with integrated weed/pest management (IWPM). It has been demonstrated that modern technology can identify a single species in wide-open spaces. As part of precision agriculture and IPM, drones are being used more and more. Drones equipped with remote sensing technology (sensors) are used to map crop performance variability, track insect and weed outbreaks, and monitor crop health. While early identification and response to inadequate abiotic conditions may avoid significant insect and weed outbreaks, they could be used as decision support tools. When outbreaks do happen, various drones (actuators) could be used to quickly address identified pest and weed hotspots. The future is automated pesticide spraying and/or biological control organism release via communication between sensor and actuation drones. Artificial intelligence\")]"

      "* Analysis: The title \"AI-powered System for Detecting and Preventing Crop Diseases in Wheat\" is somewhat unique, but it shares similarities with other projects that focus on AI applications in agriculture. However, the specific emphasis on wheat crops differentiates it from more general agricultural projects.\n",

      "**Likelihood of Grant Approval: 60%**\n",
      "\n",
      "The input project, \"Establishing a drone-based system to monitor and prevent illegal deforestation in protected forest reserves,\" shares some similarities with previous projects in the dataset. The most notable similarity is with the project \"Exploring Artificial Intelligence and Geospatial Techniques for the Quantification of Forest Fires\" (hereafter referred to as Project A). While both projects utilize AI, drones, and satellite data, they differ in focus: Project A aims to detect and prevent forest fires, whereas the input project targets illegal deforestation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This similarity reduces the likelihood of grant approval by 10% due to potential concerns about redundancy. However, it also presents an opportunity for differentiation, as the input project addresses a distinct issue (illegal deforestation) within the broader context of forest management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Innovative or Unique Aspects:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The input project exhibits some innovative aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Combination of AI and Satellite Data**: The integration of AI with satellite data to provide real-time alerts for illegal deforestation is an innovative approach, as it leverages the strengths of both technologies.\n",
      "2. **Specific Focus on Deforestation**: While Project A deals with forest fires, the input project's focus on preventing illegal deforestation in protected areas is a unique aspect that warrants consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the overall uniqueness score is not high enough to justify a grant likelihood score of 80-90%. The input project's similarity to Project A and lack of groundbreaking innovation limit its uniqueness score to around 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actionable Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the project's chances of grant approval:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Emphasize Differentiation**: Highlight how the input project addresses a specific issue (illegal deforestation) within the broader context of forest management, which sets it apart from Project A.\n",
      "2. **Enhance Innovation**: Consider incorporating more cutting-edge technologies or approaches to further differentiate the input project from existing initiatives.\n",
      "3. **Address Unmet Needs**: Emphasize how the input project can contribute to reducing redundancy and better aligning with unmet needs in the dataset, such as improving forest management practices or enhancing conservation efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these areas of improvement, the input project's likelihood of grant approval may increase to 70-80%.\n",
