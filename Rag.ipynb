Increased study attempts have concentrated on these situations to design and synthesize novel, cost-effective, and sturdy photocatalysts that can improve H2 production efficiency at low prices with minimal over-potential\\n Phase 1: Synthesis\\nGO will be prepared by the Hummers method, CNTs will be synthesized by the catalytic decomposition process, and the g-C3N4 nanosheets (shorted as CN) will be fabricated by annealing urea at 550 °C. The metal oxide and dichalcogenides solutions will be prepared by mixing their precursor’s solution drop-wise while keeping on normal stirring. The GO and CNTs will be then introduced to the mixed solutions and will be shifted to the Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave will be heated hydrothermally in a vacuum oven at 200 oC for 24 hrs. The obtained samples will then be washed several times with distilled water and dried overnight.\\nPhase 2: Electrochemical Measurements\\n10 mg of the prepared photocatalyst is dissolved in 250 μL ethylene glycol, 250 μL of absolute ethanol, and 40 μL of coating solution and sonicated for 1 hour. Afterward, the solution is pasted on ITO and dried in the oven at 70 oC for 5 hours. Then the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Mott-Schottky curves (M-S), photocurrents (PC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the catalysts were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI–660E, Shanghai, China) having platinum plate (counter electrode),  Ag/AgCl (reference electrode) and 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as the supporting electrolyte. \\uf076Supply clean fuels and electricity securely to satisfy the world's increasing demand.\\n\\uf076Eliminate pollution issues with the environment and stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy utilization.\\n\\uf076Increase power effectiveness by creating new power technologies to overcome the current wasteful power system’s thermodynamic boundaries.\\n\\uf076Sustainable and secure energy development, including renewable energy.\\n\\uf076Sustainable development of organic materials with carbon-based feedstock.

The project will initiate with an effective feasibility study, including present and future load demand, as well as the cost factor and expected outcomes. The study will lead to an analytic approach for designing the grid-tie PV systems, such that the ownership price is reduced and nominal performance is retained under diverse scenarios. The next activity would be to synthesize real-time optimal energy management of the designed system. This energy management would stand uniquely amongst market-based simplistic solutions owing to its optimal nature. The overall methodology would facilitate a robust switching framework among generational sources depending on the state of load, grid, and battery. It will also take into account the uncertainties (load, source, weather, etc.). The existing system will be properly expanded to encompass this study and to meet the future load demand.\\nFinally, the performance of the proposed system will be monitored under real-time scenarios for at least a year, including seasonal variations and uncertainties at both load and generation end. The monitored data will be saved and interpreted in the form of a feasibility report which will not only be shared with the scientific community but with academia, and industry, and will also be available for public usage. -- Preparation of an authentic database and associated literature providing real-time resource profiles and relevant operational schemes.\\n-- A robust and flexible simulator for investigating the performance of PV systems on virtual grounds.\\n-- Design and development of moderate power prototype for residential applications.\\n-- Synthesize an optimal energy management system with real-time monitoring system.\\n-- Generation of feasibility reports for the scientific community, academia, industry, and public usage.
